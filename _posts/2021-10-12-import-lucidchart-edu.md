Lucidchart recently limited their free education plans, Lucidchart EDU, for students and teachers to only 3 editable diagrams. That means that all of the diagrams after your most recent three diagram files are set to read only, unless you switch to a premium subscription. 

Individual licenses for educational apps can be quite expensive. This is especially hard for parents with multiple children in distance learning, or educators who are provided with a limited selection of remote tools.

You can create and edit an unlimited number of diagrams for free with diagrams.net

Because diagrams.net works on a [bring-your-own-storage model](/blog/secure-diagramming-storage.html), your files are not locked behind a paywall. You can choose to store your files in many different cloud storage locations (Google Drive, OneDrive, Github, ... ), in your browser, or on your local computer. You are free to view, edit, publish share them at any time. 

**Tip:** [diagrams.net also integrates well with Google Classroom](/blog/google-classroom-diagrams.html). See below for more details.

## How to import Lucidchart diagrams

By using the free diagrams.net and draw.io Importer extension for the Google Chrome browser, you can convert all of your Lucidchart diagrams to draw.io in a couple of steps.
