FOSDEM is a free two-day event held each year, organised by volunteers, to promote the use and development of free and open source software. Open source software developers and users can meet, share ideas, and collaborate.

FOSDEM’20 will be held at the Université Libre de Bruxelles Solbosch Campus in Brussels, Belgium on 1-2 February 2020.

There is no registration and the event is free to attend!

## We are a sponsor of FOSDEM’20

As an [open source technology stack](https://github.com/jgraph) and one of the world’s most widely used browser-based diagramming applications, we are [proud to be sponsoring FOSDEM’20](https://fosdem.org/2020/about/sponsors/) and supporting open source developers around the world.

Open source has a huge number of advantages for customers. With diagrams.net you get the following benefits.

  - Increased trust – anyone can scrutinise the source code.
  - Extendable – open source encourages third-parties to develop integrations with various platforms.
  - No lock-in SaaS – you’ll always have access to the desktop app even if the website goes away.

Our goal is to _provide free, high quality diagramming software for everyone_ and disrupt the world of diagramming tools.

## FOSDEM: hundreds of open source speakers and events

With thousands of attendees from all over the world taking place, it’s one of the largest events for open source projects. The 400+ speakers and 500+ events are organised by a hard-working team of volunteers.

In this 20th instalment of the conference, it’s free to participate in [more than 50 developer rooms](https://fosdem.org/2020/news/2019-10-01-accepted-developer-rooms/) where talks, hacking sessions and open discussions are held on a huge variety of topics, all related to open source development and projects.

In addition to the developer rooms, there are keynotes, main track talks, as well as stands you visit to chat in person with open source project developers. Certification organisations also run several exams during the conference that visitors can take.

Keep an eye on the [FOSDEM website](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/) or follow []@fosdem on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fosdem) as the schedule of speakers and events are confirmed.
