You can now create a new diagram even faster by going to [diagram.new](https://diagram.new) or [diagrams.new](https://diagrams.new) instead of having to remember the full [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) address.

``.new`` is the first and only domain that is devoted to helping you get things done fast. Each and every address that ends with .new is an action that lets you create or share content online.

## The .new domain helps you create content quickly

Google has set up the ``.new`` domain exclusively to help you create and work with content quickly and easily.
Several different types of content and actions are available already:

For example:
* [repo.new](https://repo.new): creates a new repository at GitHub.
* [sheet.new](https://sheet.new): creates a new Google spreadsheet.
* [story.new](https://story.new): creates a new story page on Medium.
* [link.new](https://link.new): creates a new short link on Bitly.
* [podcast.new](https://podcast.new): creates a new podcast using Anchor and Spotify.
* [diagram.new](https://diagram.new) and [diagrams.new](https://diagrams.new): creates a new diagram using diagrams.net

Instead of remembering the full URL of the websites and services, just enter the type of content you want to create or action you want to do and add ``.new`` to the end.

### Only trusted apps

As there is a rigorous application process with a well-defined [registration and security policy](https://whats.new/#registration), Google only grants trusted and reliable applications or shortcuts a ``.new`` address.

## Try it out

Go to [diagram.new](https://diagram.new) and create a new diagram.
