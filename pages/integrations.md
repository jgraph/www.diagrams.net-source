At diagrams.net, being open source means anyone can take the project, change it, deploy it and integrate it.

In fact, the [free online diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) tool has already been integrated into a wide variety of platforms, and is available to be deployed as a self-hosted docker application, or used as a stand-alone private diagramming application.

The integrations are branded under our diagrams.net and draw.io names, it's still the same editor underneath.

### diagrams.net Desktop

diagrams.net desktop is a stand-alone, offline application available for Windows, macOS and Linux. This is ideal if you want the enhanced security of a desktop application with no reliance on an internet connection. [Get the desktop app today](https://get.diagrams.net/)

### Online at diagrams.net

Create, edit and view diagrams using the free diagrams.net application online at [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net). You can even use it as [a diagram viewer for files created by another diagramming tool](/blog/online-diagram-viewer.html).

* **Mobile diagramming:** Add a web link to diagrams.net on your mobile device's home screen to diagram on-the-go. The Minimal theme is great for mobile devices.
* **Flexible file storage:** Store your diagrams where you need them - on [Google Drive](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=google), [OneDrive](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=onedrive), [GitHub](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=github), [GitLab](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=gitlab), [Dropbox](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=dropbox), or on your local device.

### Self-hosted, secure, container-deployable

diagrams.net is designed to be easy to configure and fast to deploy in a container.

### Google Workspace add-ons for Docs, Sheets and Slides

### Microsoft Sharepoint, OneDrive, Office 365 and Teams integrations

### GitHub app

The [draw.io app for GitHub](https://github.com/apps/draw-io-app) lets you authorise access to individual repositories, and will replace the older OAuth authorisation method.

## 3rd-party integrations

The following integrations are not directly provided by the diagrams.net team. The Atlassian integrations are built by us, but provided via an Atlassian partner.

Most integrations use the name draw.io, the previous name for diagrams.net.

### Atlassian Confluence and Jira

The draw.io apps for Confluence and Jira are available via the Atlassian Marketplace for Cloud, Data Centre and Server. [draw.io for Confluence](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210933/draw-io-diagrams-for-confluence) is the highest-rated app on the Atlassian Marketplace.

* **Enterprise file management support:** Even if your company doesn't want to store diagrams inside the Confluence or Jira instance, you can take advantage of the app's [integrations with Google Drive and Microsoft's OneDrive](/doc/faq/embed-diagram-googledrive-confluence-cloud.html).
* **Flexible customisation:** By using these apps within your Confluence and Jira environment, you can [customise many aspects to make it easier for your employees to diagram](/doc/faq/): templates, shapes, shape libraries, colour palettes and style to match your corporate image, plugins, and even the user interface can be customised.
