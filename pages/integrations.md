At diagrams.net, being open source means anyone can take the project, deploy it, integrate it, and sell it.

In fact, the [free online diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) tool has already been integrated into a wide variety of platforms, and is available to be deployed as a self-hosted docker application, or used as a stand-alone private diagramming application.

## Secure diagramming
Open source provides you with more robust security because flaws and security holes can't be hidden. Everyone can scrutinise the application code, stored publicly on Github.

### Your diagram data stays private
Your diagram data is stored in your browser while you are editing it, and at a location of your choice. If you choose a cloud host such as GOogle Drive, your diagram data is transmitted with end-to-end encryption. The diagrams.net application does not store your diagram data, and therefore eliminates the risk of security breaches.

### diagrams.net Desktop

diagrams.net desktop is a stand-alone, offline application available for Windows, macOS and Linux. This is ideal if you want the enhanced security of a desktop application with no reliance on an internet connection. [Get the desktop app today](https://get.diagrams.net/)

### Online at diagrams.net

Create, edit and view diagrams using the free diagrams.net application online at [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net). You can even use it as [a diagram viewer for files created by another diagramming tool](/blog/online-diagram-viewer.html).

* **Mobile diagramming:** Add a web link to diagrams.net on your mobile device's home screen to diagram on-the-go. The Minimal theme is great for mobile devices.
* **Flexble file storage:** Store your diagrams where you need them - on [Google Drive](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=google), [OneDrive](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=onedrive), [Github](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=github), [GitLab](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=gitlab), [Dropbox](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=dropbox), or on your local device.

### Self-hosted, secure, container-deployable

diagrams.net is designed to be easy to configure and fast to deploy in a container.

### G Suite add-ons for Docs, Sheets and Slides

Diagrams.net lets you [store your diagram files in Google Drive](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=google) and [work with them in G Suite](https://gsuite.draw.io/). There are also add-ons available for [Docs](https://docsaddon.draw.io/), [Sheets](https://sheetsaddon.draw.io/) and [Slides](https://slidesaddon.draw.io/).

[See how to use the diagrams.net add-ons for G Suite](/blog/diagrams-google-docs.html)

### Sharepoint, OneDrive and Office 365 integration

diagrams.net works with [OneDrive and Sharepoint](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=onedrive). An [Office 365 app](https://office.draw.io/) is available for Word, Powerpoint and Excel.

### Diagramming in Quip

All users in your Quip instance can add diagrams to pages and edit them, without switching contexts. The diagramming application and your data are both hosted within Quip. [See the Quip integration on our Github repository](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-quip)

## 3rd-party Integrations

The following integrations are not developed by the diagrams.net team.

### Atlassian Confluence and Jira

diagrams.net is available via the draw.io apps for Confluence and Jira, available via the Atlassian Marketplace for Cloud, Data Centre and Server. [draw.io for Confluence](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1214854/diagram-viewer-for-confluence-cloud) is the highest-rated app on the Atlassian Marketplace.

_diagrams.net is currently funded via this third-party integration with Atlassian software - that's why we call diagrams.net commercial open-source._
