At draw.io, being open source means anyone can take the project, change it, deploy it and integrate it.

In fact, draw.io and our [free online editor](https://app.diagrams.net) tool has already been integrated into a wide variety of platforms, and is available to be deployed as a self-hosted docker application, or used as a stand-alone private diagramming application.

Although the integrations may be branded under our diagrams.net and draw.io names, it's the same editor underneath.

### draw.io Desktop

draw.io desktop is a stand-alone, offline application available for Windows, macOS and Linux. This is ideal if you want the enhanced security of a desktop application with no reliance on an internet connection. [Get the desktop app today](https://get.diagrams.net/)

### Online at app.diagrams.net

Create, edit and view diagrams using our free diagramming application online at [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net). You can even use it as [a diagram viewer for files created by another diagramming tool](/blog/online-diagram-viewer.html).

* **Mobile diagramming:** Add a web link to app.diagrams.net on your mobile device's home screen to diagram on-the-go. The Minimal theme is great for mobile devices.
* **Flexible file storage:** Store your diagrams where you need them - on [Google Drive](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=google), [OneDrive](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=onedrive), [GitHub](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=github), [GitLab](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=gitlab), [Dropbox](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=dropbox), or on your local device.

### Self-hosted, secure, container-deployable

* **Enterprise file management support:** Even if your company doesn't want to store diagrams inside the Confluence or Jira instance, you can take advantage of the app's [integrations with Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive](/doc/faq/embed-diagram-googledrive-confluence-cloud.html).
* **Flexible customisation:** By using draw.io within your Confluence and Jira environment, you can [customise many aspects to make it easier for your employees to diagram](/doc/faq/): templates, shapes, shape libraries, colour palettes and style to match your corporate image, plugins, and even the user interface can be customised.
* **Easy migration:** If you have many Gliffy and/or LucidChart OnPrem diagrams in your Confluence instances, you can convert all of these to draw.io diagrams with one click in the app administration section.
