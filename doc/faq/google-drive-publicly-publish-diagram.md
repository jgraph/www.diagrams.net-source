### Link options
* **Links** - Decides whether links are opened in the same browser window or a new one. _Automatic_ opens anchor and relative links, as well as links within your domain in the same browser window, whereas absolute links will open in a new browser tab by default.
* **Border Color** - Sets the colour to highlight links when you hover over them with the mouse.
* Lightbox - Shows the diagram in a lightbox (read-only) or in the diagram editor (uses the diagram as template).
   * **Edit** - Enables an _Edit_ button in the lightbox which opens the diagram in diagrams.net.
   * **Layers** - Selects which layers are displayed in the lightbox.

## Permissions

If the diagram file on Google Drive is public, the linked diagram will not require anyone to login to see it. However, if the diagram file is not public, you must login and authorise full read-access to all files in your Google Drive before your browser can load the diagram.
