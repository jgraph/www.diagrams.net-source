Make sure you have logged into your Dropbox account and [authorised diagrams.net (draw.io)](/doc/faq/dropbox-diagrams-store.html) to store and edit diagrams stored there.

1. Go to [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/?mode=dropbox) and click _Open Existing Diagram_. If you are already in the diagram editor and using Dropbox to store your diagrams, select _File > Open_ from the menu.
2. Navigate to the diagram file in your Dropbox folders, select it, then click _Choose_ to open it in the diagrams.net editor.

**Note:** If you have stored a diagram file outside of the _app>drawio_ folder, diagrams.net will copy it on an automatic save. This is because Dropbox only allows diagrams.net to store data in this specific folder.

You don't need to manually save your diagram after you make changes to it - diagrams.net will save a new version of your diagram regularly while you are editing.
