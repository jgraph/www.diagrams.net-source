By default, a new diagram will use the page view - the grid stops where the edge of your selected paper size ends.

If your diagram expands across multiple pages, a light dashed line will appear on the grid to indicate the page borders, as if you would print the diagram at 100% zoom.

**Note:** This dashed line and the [editor grid](/doc/faq/editor-grid-change.html) isn't printed with your diagram - they are just guidelines to help you align and resize shapes and connectors. 

You can hide or display this page view in the editor - your diagram will still print across pages as normal when you hide it.

1. Make sure nothing is selected in your diagram so you can see the _Diagram_ tab in the format panel. 
2. Click to deselect the checkbox next to _Page View_ to expand the grid to fill the entire drawing canvas.

3. Click again to re-enable _Page View_.
