When you [print a diagram](/doc/faq/print-diagram.html), you can choose to fit it to the page, or print it across multiple pages.

1. Select _File > Print_ from the menu in diagrams.net to open the print options. Alternatively, press ``Ctrl+P`` on Windows or ``Cmd+P`` on macOS.
2. Click on the _Fit to_ radio button, and type the number of sheets of paper across, and pages down that you want to _stretch_ your diagram over. If you want to fit this page of your diagram onto a single sheet of paper, leave the values as ``1`` sheet across and ``1`` sheet down.

3. You'll see a preview of how your diagram will be printed along with your operating system's printer dialog. Choose your printer and follow its instructions to print your diagram.

<br />**Tip:** Instead of printing to a printer, you can [print your diagram that you have fit over multiple sheets to a PDF file](/doc/faq/pdf-print-to.html).
