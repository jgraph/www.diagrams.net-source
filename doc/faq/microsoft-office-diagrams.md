2. Drag the grab handles on the side or corners to resize it.
3. Drag the rotate handle at the top of your diagram to rotate it.

### Recolour your diagram

### Update embedded diagrams to see changes

When the diagram file that is stored in your Google Drive or One Drive has been edited in diagrams.net, you'll need to regenerate the images to see those changes reflected in your document.

1. Select the _Insert_ tab in the toolbar.
2. Select the diagram you want to update, and click _Update Selected_. To update all of the diagrams in your document, click _Update All_.
