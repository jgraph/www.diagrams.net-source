There are two types of shapes in diagrams.net where you can add new rows.
* ERD tables use the new extended table tools in the _Arrange_ tab of the format panel.
* Simpler text lists and UML class shapes use the row shapes to add new rows.

## Add a row to a table or ERD table shape

1. Select the table and click a second time to select a cell.
2. In the _Arrange_ tab of the format panel, click the _Insert Row After_ or the _Insert Row Above_ button. If you had selected the entire table shape, a blank row will be inserted at the end or at the start of your table, otherwise it will be inserted before or after the selected cell.

## Add a row to a list or UML class shape

1. Drag a _List Item_ shape from the _Entity Relation_ shape library and drop it over your list shape to insert a new entry.
2. Drag an _Item_ shape from the _UML_ shape library and drop it over your class shape to insert a new attribute or method.

## Use a keyboard shortcut to add a row

Alternatively, you can highlight a row and press ``Ctrl+Enter`` on Windows or ``Cmd+Enter`` on macOS to insert a copy of the row directly below in either the new table shapes or the older list shapes.
