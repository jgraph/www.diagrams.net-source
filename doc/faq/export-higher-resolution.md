When you export your diagram to a PNG image, they are not generated at print quality by default. You can create a larger image that is at a higher resolution (for print) by using the zoom function in the export dialog.

1. Select _File > Export as > PNG_ from the menu.
2. Change the _Zoom_ to a higher percentage, 200% or 300%, for example.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/export-high-resolution-image.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Change the zoom level when generating a PNG to export a high resolution image of your diagram">
3. Set the other options as you need, then click _Export_. When you use the PNG image in a document or on the web, restrict its dimensions to effectively display the image at a higher resolution (DPI).

This method is used instead of specifying a DPI, as most image programs ignore such specifications. If yo want to set default zoom value then use _File > Properties_ and change the _Zoom_ to new default.
